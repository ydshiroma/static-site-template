This template can be used for longform text. You can also insert an image, for example:

{% include modal-figure.html
  imgFile = "paines-nightly-pest.jpg"
  imgAlt = "Paine sleeps on a bed of straw, surrounded by parodies of his works, watched over by Fox and Priestley as guardian angels, and dreams of his trial. A demon holding a fiddle and sheet music inscribed 'Ca ira' flees through the window."
  imgSize = "max-width:500px"
  imgCaption = "<a href='https://diglib.amphilsoc.org/islandora/object/graphics%3A7694' target='_blank'><i>Tom Paine's Nightly Pest</i></a>, James Gillray, 1797"
%}

You can also insert a blockquote. See [here](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/content/typography/) for more formatting possibilities.

<figure>
    <blockquote class="blockquote">
        <p>"MEOW, MEOW, MEOW."</p>
    </blockquote>
    <figcaption class="blockquote-footer">
        Signora Neroni in <cite title="Dinnertime for Cats">Dinnertime for Cats</cite>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

See below for an example References section. If you prefer, you can use <a href="{{ '/essays/text-with-footnotes' | relative_url }}">hyperlinked footnotes</a> instead.
