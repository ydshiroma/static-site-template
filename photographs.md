These photos were taken by the linguist Mary Haas during her field work with Sesostrie Youchingant in the 1930s. The original photos do not include information on the year they were taken or the places where they were taken. It is known that Haas worked with Sesostrie both in the Marksville, Louisiana area and in the area of Eufaula, Oklahoma. We welcome insights that would clarify the location or other information about these photos.

These are drawn from a <a href="https://diglib.amphilsoc.org/islandora/object/tunica-album?sort_order=ASC&sort_by=title&page=%2C0" target="_blank">larger collection</a> of Mary Haas Tunica photos available on the APS Digital Library.
