These photos were all taken around 1940 by the archaeologist Stuart Neitzel for the anthropologist Frank Speck. The largest set of photos were taken by Neitzel during a trip by Speck to the Marksville area. They feature many members of the Barbry and Pierite families and include people showing how to use Tunica style stickball sticks. Other photos include a set featuring Joseph Pierite, Sr. demonstrating how to prepare hides.

These are drawn from a <a href="https://diglib.amphilsoc.org/islandora/object/subcollection-1-series-iii-frank-g-speck-papers?f%5B0%5D=subject%3AIndigenous%20peoples--Louisiana&sort_order=ASC&sort_by=title" target="_blank">larger collection</a> of Frank Speck Tunica photos available in the APS Digital Library.
